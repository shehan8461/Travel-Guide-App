May it be an elegantly cascading beauty that requires a few hours of hiking to reach, or a gushing mass of impatient waterfall you randomly encounter by the roadside, Sri Lanka has it all covered. Having the highest waterfall density in the world with a recorded 382 waterfalls spread throughout the country, Sri Lanka is the place to be to see all kinds of waterfalls.
Fed by two half-yearly monsoons, rivers rush down the rocky precipices and form spectacular waterfalls. Only some of these picturesque waterfalls can be viewed with ease as the others are located inside thick forests and around tea plantations.

Fishing is the widespread occupation of most folk living along the coastal belt of Sri Lanka thus many fishing villages are abound, also the use many different ways to catch fish. Most note worthy of mentioning is “stilt fishing” technique found in the southern coastal areas. The deep south and eastern coastal areas are still under developed as far as tourism is concerned, but has the best sceneries’ and also the best places to enjoy an authentic village lifestyle, in Sri Lanka. Once the sun dips over the horizon a whole new nocturnal world opens up for the visitor with the rhythmic moan of the Loris, the long continuous note of the cicada bringing a primeval ambience to life. Ideal time to walk along the beach to watch fisherman either returning with the days catch, or leaving on their daily work, or watch turtles beaching to lay eggs, four types of turtles frequent Sri Lankan waters, the turtles are protected by law in Sri Lanka and possessing items made from turtle carapace carries penalties, but you could support various turtle conservation projects or simply watch turtle in their natural habitat, or even get involved in releasing young ones to see and watch their mad scramble towards the breaking waves.
